# NeuralNetworkMLProject
Python implementation of Neural Network for a school project

### nnScriptWithForLoops
This is the naive implementation using for loops, but it might be easier to see what's going on with this version.

### nnScript
The MUCH-faster implementation utilizing numpy functions. To run, just do "python nnScript.py" in the command line,
make sure you have also downloaded the .mat file, which is the training data input.
